                            Boost your immune system – In a similar vein to the above, studies have shown children growing up on farms have more powerful immune systems, more robust gut microbiomes and experience fewer chronic childhood diseases. This is typically attributed to more movement, higher levels of vitamin D through frequent sun exposure and the regular inhalation of barnyard dust which, contrary to what you may believe, is microbe-rich and helps boost immunity

                            <p class="bold">Farmers are among our greatest conservation allies. They produce the crops that help to feed, fuel and clothe a growing world, while caring for the lands and waters on which their livelihoods depend. As the global population continues to grow, farmers will be under increasing pressure to produce even more crops without sacrificing the environment.

                            The solution is right under our feet – the soil.

                            By adopting conservation practices, farmers can build rich, fertile soils that will grow robust crops while protecting water sources, storing carbon, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and creating fields that are more resilient to extreme weather events. It’s a win-win for farmers and nature.
